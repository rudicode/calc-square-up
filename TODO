TODO

x) Squareup has too many constants in the formula. They are really variables
which are constant now but change when different tooling is used and we get
feedback from the machines actual cut values.

x) the main script needs to get the input for the plate sizes from the user.
Command line now works, but if it is not 3 arguments then it uses defaults.
need to impliment interactive input if the correct number of args not inputed.

x) Add the ability to choose from different tool setups.
