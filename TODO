TODO

x) Need to perform error checking on initilize method. Make sure that the in
sizes are within correct range so that the calculation will not throw up.

x) the main script needs to get the input for the plate sizes from the user.
Command line now works, but if it is not 3 arguments then it uses defaults.
need to impliment interactive input if the correct number of args not inputed.

x) Add the ability to choose from different tool setups.
