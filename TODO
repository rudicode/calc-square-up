TODO

x) move Squareup to its own file squareup.rb and require it in calc-squareup.rb

x) Squareup has too many constants in the formula. They are really varriables
which are constant now but change when different tooling is used and we get
feedback from the machines actual cut values.

x) the main script needs to get the input for the plate sizes from the user.
If valid command line arguments are supplied then use those, else interactivly
ask for them.
